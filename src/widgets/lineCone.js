// @ts-check
// lineCone.js — the two-step correlation elicitation as a named instrument:
//
//   "What is the most likely relationship?"  -> the line follows the pointer,
//                                               a click sets it.
//   "What are the plausible alternatives?"   -> the cone opens with the pointer,
//                                               a click sets that too.
//
// ── It is a PRESET, not a mark ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// A correlation belief is a trend line with its intercept pinned at the origin and
// its slope confined to [-1, 1]; the cone is that line's uncertainty band. So this
// widget is `trendBand` + `trend` over one dataset, with the correlation stated as
// two `clamp` constraints and a pinned `intercept` channel — nothing here is baked
// into a mark. (There used to be a `cone` mark that hard-coded all of it in
// degrees; the general marks subsume it.)
//
// Stage 0 owns the slope, stage 1 owns the spread. The `probe` driver previews each
// as a ghost and commits on click, then advances — so once a field is set, its edit
// is gated off and the value is frozen, exactly as the original study instrument
// behaved.
//
// ── Why the plot is square ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// r is read as an ANGLE: the line should sweep ±45° as r goes -1 -> +1. In slope
// space that holds only when one x unit and one y unit are the same number of
// pixels, so the widget sizes its margins to make the INNER plot square over the
// matched [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] domains. Change `width`/`height` and it stays square;
// the outer box just gets a wider frame.
//
// Read the answer at any point with container.getData() ->
// [{ r, spread }] where `r` is the correlation in [-1, 1] and `spread` is the
// half-width of the plausible envelope in the same units. `container.on('stage')`
// tells you which question the reader is on (2 = both answered).
//
// Returns an ElicitSpec: Elicit(lineCone({ x: 'Exercise', y: 'Body weight' })).
